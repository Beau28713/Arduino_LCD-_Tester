# LCD Tester Documentation

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the LCD Tester project. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding, assembling, and using the LCD Tester powered by an Arduino Micro. This tool is designed to facilitate the testing of every row and column of swappable LCDs, ensuring their proper functionality. The electronic circuit for this project is built on a perfboard using various electronic components.

## Project Overview

The LCD Tester project aims to provide a simple, efficient, and reliable method for testing Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs). By leveraging the compact and powerful Arduino Micro, this tester can systematically activate each row and column of an LCD, allowing users to identify any malfunctioning segments easily. The design's flexibility accommodates different LCD models by enabling swappable connections.

## Components Required

To build the LCD Tester, you will need the following components:

- 1x Arduino Micro
- 1x Perfboard
- Various resistors and capacitors
- Connection wires
- LCD connector sockets
- Power supply (USB or external as per your requirement)
- Any additional components as specified in the schematic

## Firmware

The firmware for the Arduino Micro is written in C++ using the PlatforIO IDE. The code sequentially activates each row and column of the connected LCD, allowing users to visually inspect the display for any defects.

To upload the firmware:

1. Connect the Arduino Micro to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the PlatformIO IDE and load the firmware.
3. Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
4. Click the "Upload" button to program the Arduino Micro.

## Usage Instructions

To test an LCD:

1. Ensure the LCD Tester is powered off.
2. Connect the LCD to the tester using the swappable connector sockets.
3. Power on the LCD Tester. The device will automatically begin the testing sequence.
4. Observe the LCD display for any missing or improperly functioning rows or columns.

## Troubleshooting

- **LCD Not Lighting Up**: Check the connections between the LCD and the tester. Ensure the power supply is correctly connected and operational.
- **Partial Display Functionality**: Re-inspect the soldered connections on the perfboard for any cold joints or bridges that might affect functionality.
